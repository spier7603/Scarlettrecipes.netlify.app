- "COOKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR FULLBLOOD WAGYU HANGER STEAKSTake hanger steaks out of fridge or freezer, and bring to room temperature. Grind coriander and cumin in a spice grinder or use a mortar and pestle. Grind until coarsely ground. Season hanger steaks with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper. Coat with coriander and cumin until well crusted, pressing to adhere all of the spices. Heat a cast iron skillet to medium-high."
- "Add enough grape seed oil to coat the pan. Once the pan is hot, place the hanger steaks in the pan. Sear each steak on all four sides for 3 minutes to achieve medium-rare. You should have a nice caramelized crust on all sides. If steak doesn’t feel done (cooked completely), you can finish cooking it in the oven."
- "COOKING INSTRUCTIONS FOR SPRING PEA PUREE Get a medium pot of boiling water. Have a separate bowl ready with ice water.Add spring peas, and blanch for 3 minutes. Afterwards, transfer peas into the bowl of ice water to shock them and retain their color.Place the following ingredients – fresh mint leaves, plain Greek yogurt, grated machengo cheese, garlic cloves, and unseasoned rice vinegar – into a food processor, and blend until smooth."

Add 1/4 cup water and 3 tablespoons of butter. Cover with aluminum foil, and bake at 375 degrees until al dente. Uncover, and stir every 15 minutes while cooking."
- "Remove foil, and cook until desired doneness. Recommended: cook for 30 minutes with aluminum foil and an additional 15 minutes without a cover to get proper caramelization"

- "Pull the rapini, and drop them into ice water. Remove rapini from the ice water once cold, and drain.Heat sauté pan, and add 2 tablespoons of grape seed oil. Sauté rapini with 1/2 cup chopped garlic scapes until heated through. Season with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper."
