recipeingredient:
- "630 g Japanese rice"
- "0.8 liters water"
- "8 ml rice vinegar"
- "3 tablespoons sugar"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put the rice in a large bowl, wash with cold water. Wash and drain the water until the water is clear. Pour the rice into a soup strainer and set aside for 30 minutes to allow it to drip well."
- "Put the rice in a pan and add the water. Let the rice soak in cold water for at least 30 minutes. Light it underneath and cook in boiled water for 15 minutes."
- "Make sushi vinegar. Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a bowl. Pour the whole into a small pan and heat until the sugar is completely dissolved. Cool the mixture."
- "Put the hot steamed rice on a large plate. Do not use a metallic container as it will prevent the interaction of rice and vinegar. The best would be a wooden plate. Sprinkle the rice with the vinegar mixture and mix quickly with a shamoji (rice spatula). Be careful not to crush the rice grains. Refrigerate and immediately make the sushi out of it."
