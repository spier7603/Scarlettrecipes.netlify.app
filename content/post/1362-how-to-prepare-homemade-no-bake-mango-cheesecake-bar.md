- "Crust base: Crush the biscuit into fine crumbs using a food processor. Or seal them in a Ziploc plastic bag and roll them with a rolling pin. Transfer into a bowl. Combine well with butter."
- "Place into a 20 cm square cake pan that has been lined with parchment paper (with an overhang around the sides if you plan to unmold the cake). Spread evenly before pressing the mixture onto the base to pack it firm. Refrigerate until the cheesecake is ready."
- "Mango cheesecake: Sprinkle gelatin evenly onto the cool water. Let it sit for at least 5 minutes to bloom."
- "In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese with a rubber spatula or whisk until creamy. Mix in sugar until it becomes really smooth."
- "In a separate bowl, whip the cream until thick with a whisk or electric mixer. Tips: the whipping process will be much faster if everything is cold, ie. bowl and whisk. Set aside once thickened."
- "In a saucepan, bring the mango puree and lemon juice to a boil. Remove from heat and add the bloomed gelatin. Stir until the gelatin is completely dissolved. Set aside 3 tablespoons of the mixture for decorating the cheesecake."
- "Combine the remaining puree with the cream cheese. Then add the cream and mix well."
- "Pour cream cheese filling into the prepared pan. Spread and smoothen the top as needed. Drop the mango puree by the teaspoon randomly over the top. Using a wooden skewer, swirl the puree into filling to create a marbled effect."
- "Cover and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or best overnight. Slice and enjoy!"
