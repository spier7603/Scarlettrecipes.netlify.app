recipeinstructions:
- "Fry the bacon in a pan as you normally would. Once crisped, remove the bacon to a plate. Let the pan cool a bit, then wipe out the grease with some kitchen towel. Put the pan back on medium heat, then add the walnuts. Let the walnuts toast (don&#39;t let them burn) for about 2 minutes, then remove them to a bowl."
- "Drop your noodles into a large pot of boiling salted water. While they cook, whip up the sauce."

- "Add the cream to the pan. Once it simmers, add the gorgonzola, a little at a time. Stir frequently to melt the cheese. Season well with freshly cracked black pepper."
- "Once the pasta&#39;s almost cooked, crumble the bacon and add it to the sauce, along with the walnuts and peas. Drag the noodles into the pan and toss to coat. If the pasta seems thick, loosen it with a ladle or so of pasta cooking water. Serve immediately."
- "Tomato salad: toss the tomatoes and lemon juice in a large bowl. Season with the salt only when you&#39;re ready to serve (or else the tomatoes will become watery)."
