recipeingredient:
- " for the pastry"
- "500 g x strong flour"
- "120 g beef suet"
- "50 g x lard"
- "200 ml x cold water"
- "1 tsp x table salt and black pepper"

- "175 g x white onion"
- "1 tbsp x chopped parsley and thyme"
- "to taste salt and pepper"
- "1 x beaten egg for glaze"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the lard, suet and water into the strong flour, along with the salt and pepper"
- "Work with your hands for a few minutes, turn out onto a work surface when it looks shaggy, and continue to knead (like bread dough for 5 minutes) until you have a firm springy dough, wrap in cling film and refrigerate while you prepare the filling, if the dough will not form keep working with damp hands it will get there."
- "Dice all of the vegetables to around 1cm, chop the herbs and mix in a bowl."
- "Now dice the skirt, it has a very obvious grain, first cut into large batons with the grain about 1 1/2 inch thickness. Turn 90 degrees and slice 1/2 cm approx against the grain"
- "Season well and thoroughly mix"
- "Cut chilled dough into 4, keep the dough covered with cling film while not in use, form 1 piece into a ball and then flatten with your hand to form a round disc."
- "Roll the pastry to the size of a large dinner plate, 10 - 12 inches, you do not need flour for this. Arrange 1/4 of the filling just below the centre."
- "Place a small slice of butter on top of the filling (opt) I have a fetish for butter and think its makes everything better, it will create a little extra steam inside while baking. Lift the far side over the filling and form a semi circle"
- "Firmly press the edges together (no water or egg required) and then crimp, have fun with this and don&#39;t obsess about perfection. Use 1 finger on 1 hand to hold the dough down and 1 finger of the other hand to fold and press the pastry over. Tuck the edges under"
- "Firmly press the pasty into shape, pierce a small hole to allow steam to vent and arrange all four on baking sheets lined with baking parchment. Brush well with beaten egg, sprinkle with sea salt or seeds before baking"
- "Bake at 170c for 1 hour 15 mins, you can&#39;t eat them until they&#39;ve cooled down, they are best eaten warm or room temp with loads of ketchup, the last image is of me looking very pleased with my pasties.
