recipeingredient:
- " Mango Tapioca Pearls"
- "1 Ripe Mango"
- "2 Cups Tapioca Starch"
- "1/2 Cup Water"
- "2 TBSP Powdered Sugar"
- " Banana Milk Tea"
- "2 Cups Almond Breeze Banana Almond Milk"
- "4 Black Tea Bags"
- " Brown Sugar to taste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Blend the mango into a smooth consistency. It must be as lump-free as possible for smooth tapioca pearls. (I used my hands.)   Taste and if you think it needs it, add the powdered sugar, along with one tablespoon of tapioca starch and the warm water. In my opinion, you want this base to be as potent as possible so the flavors hold up after being boiled."
- "Tapioca starch needs heat to ‘activate’ and work the way we need it to create mango boba pearls. In fact, most ‘mistakes’ made when making homemade tapioca pearls have to do with temperature.   Transfer the mixture to a medium pan and heat over medium heat, stirring constantly."
- "Allow the mixture to cool for just a couple of minutes before adding the remainder of the tapioca starch. Add it a little bit at a time, mixing vigorously in-between.   Keep adding tapioca until a shiny, non-sticky dough forms. It may be easier towards the end to knead it with your hands on a kitchen surface dusted with extra starch, but be careful as it is hot.  As soon as it’s ready, wrap the dough with plastic wrap."
- "Pull off a little of the dough at a time, keeping the rest wrapped tightly to stop it from drying out.  Dust your countertop with tapioca starch and roll the dough out into a long rope/snake.Then cut the rope into pieces small pieces. (Keep in mind the pearls will expand when cooking.)  Roll each piece into a ball, then dust them with tapioca starch to stop them from sticking together. Repeat this with the remaining dough.  *Freeze any pearls you don’t plan to use immediately."
- "Place the pearls in a pot with boiling water and simmer at a lower temperature for 20 minutes with a lid on. Then remove the pan from the heat, keep the lid on, and allow them to steam for a further 20 minutes. The mango tapioca balls should be slightly translucent with a slightly ‘bouncy’ texture. Drain the pearls through strainer &amp; rinse with cold water to stop the cooking process and rinse off excess starch."
- "Place boba pearls in a syrup of your choosing. I boil brown sugar, crushed mangos, and water together until the sugar dissolves for this recipe."
- "Bring 2 cups of banana almond milk to a boil. Steep 4 black tea bags in the milk for 5 minutes on low heat. Turn heat off and let milk tea cool. Then add the pearls, ice cubes (if using), and the banana milk tea. Enjoy!"
