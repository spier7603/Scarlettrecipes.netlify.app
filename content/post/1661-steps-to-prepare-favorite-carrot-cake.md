recipeingredient:
- "5 oz of flour"
- "3 tsp of baking powder"
- "2 tsp of cinnamon"
- "9 oz of peeled and grated carrot"
- "5 oz of sugar"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "2 eggs"
- "3 tbsp of Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain"
- "2 oz of raisins"
- "2 1/2 oz of nuts"
- "1 oz of pistachios"
- " For the cheese frosting"
- "10 oz of icing sugar"
- "5 1/2 oz of softened butter"
- "14 oz of cream cheese"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 340°F and place a rack in the middle of the oven."
- "In a large bowl, mix the flour, yeast and ground cinnamon with a mixing spoon."
- "In a medium bowl mix the egg, Extra Virgin Olive Oil from Spain, sugar and salt with a spoon."
- "Peel and grate the carrot using a grater or shred it with a food processor. You can add the raisins and walnuts, if you want to, to the flour mixture. Stir until the flour coats all the carrot, raisins and nuts. This step will help the carrot, raisins, and nuts not to stick together in balls in the mix when baking."
- "To stop the mix sticking to the mold, brush the mold with Olive Oil from Spain and sprinkle flour on it. Shake it and then turn it upside down, to get rid of the excess flour."
- "Add the liquid ingredients from the medium bowl to the large bowl of dry ingredients, and stir well with a tongue-type spatula, not a spoon, as we want to mix them evenly into the mix without working it too much."
- "Once well mixed, put it into the previously prepared mold and put it on the rack in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes."
- "Remove and let cool. Remove from the mold to serve."
- "Mix the icing and decorate your cake!"
