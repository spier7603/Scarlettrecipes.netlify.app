recipeingredient:
- "2 1/2 Cups Flour"
- "1 1/2 Cups Sugar"
- "4 Eggs"
- "1 Cup Canola Oil"
- "3 Cups Grated Carrots"
- "1 Cup Unsweetened Apple Sauce"
- "3/4 Cup Chopped Raisins"

- "1 Tsp Baking Soda"
- "Pinch Salt"
- "1/2 Tsp Ground Cloves"
- "1/2 Grated Fresh Nutmeg"
- "1 1/2 Tsp. Cinnamon"
- "Splash Vanilla Extract"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 350 F. Prepare all of the ingredients. Peel and shred the carrots. Chop the raisins and coconut. Measure out all of the ingredients. Prepare yourself to be successful. If you have cloves already ground, great. If not, grind them with a mortar and pestle. Add all dry ingredients and whisk together."
- "Heavily grease your pan and flour it lightly. Add oil and one egg to the dry ingredients. Incorporate it. Then, add one egg at a time and incorporate. Alternately add in your carrots and dried fruits, mixing throughly after each addition. (You can also add in some chopped nuts)."
- "If you’re using a 9x13, Bundt, or springform Pan, you can go ahead and just pour all the batter in nicely. Smaller pans, be mindful that the cake will grow and possibly overflow."
- "Small cakes were done in about 22 minutes. The larger one took around 45 minutes. It’s not a bad idea to check visually and with a toothpick when it’s near completion. You can feel it... and smell it. Frosting is up to you, I found it sweet enough as is. I added a glaze to the lamb to make it attractive to my nephew."
