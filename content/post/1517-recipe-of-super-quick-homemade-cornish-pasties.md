recipeinstructions:
- "For the Pastry:"
- "Mix dry ingredients into a large bowl. Add in the butter and shortening in small chunks. Mix on a stand-up mixer with a pastry extension tool. Mix on a lower setting until it becomes a uniform dough."
- "The dough should be covered with a towel and placed in the refrigerator for about 4 hours. Longer is okay."
- "Take the dough out of the fridge and divide into 6 or 7 sections on a clean, flat, floured surface."
- "Take each dough section one at a time and roll it out flat. I like to use wax paper between the dough and the rolling pin so it doesn&#39;t stick."
- "Once flat, use a round dish like a plate to shape the dough into a circle. Repeat these steps with the other dough sections."
- "You can now fill the pastries with the filling. Be sure not to fill it too full as you will not be able to fold the pastry."
- "Fold the pastry in half, carefully. Flouring your fingers and hands will help the pastry not stick to your fingers as you fold it."
- "Once folded, crimp the edges of the pastry with your fingers."
- "Brush the outside of each pastry with beaten egg. Then, make a little slit at the top of each Pasty to vent."
- "For the filling:"
- "Cut up all the vegetables. I use a large, very sharp knife. However, if you have a Ninja Food Processor or other electric chopper, I would highly recommend using it."
- "Cut up the raw meat into 1/2 inch pieces."
- "When filling the pastries, salt and pepper between layers."
- "Preheat oven to 350 degrees"
- "Place the Pasties on a greased cooking sheet. You may also line the sheet with aluminum foil."
- "Bake in the oven uncovered for about 50 minutes. If the outer crust is a light brown color, they are done."
- "Take the Pasties out of the oven and let cool for about 20 minutes. They will be VERY hot inside and will burn your mouth if you don&#39;t let them cool down properly."
