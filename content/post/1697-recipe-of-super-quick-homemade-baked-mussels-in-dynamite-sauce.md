recipeingredient:
- "2 dozen Mussels"
- "1 pinch Hon Dashi pellets"
- "1 tbsp half and half"
- "3/4 cup Kewpie Mayonnaise"
- "1 tsp Sriracha"
- "1 tbsp masago smelt eggs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pre-heat your broiler or toaster to 350°F"
- "If using live mussels, cover and steam in a basket or colander over boiling water just until the mussels pop open. Then take them off the heat immediately. Discard the she&#39;ll not connected to the meat and arrange the mussels on the half she&#39;ll, meat side up, on a foil-lined baking pan."
- "Do not use a cookie sheet because there will be escaping juices."
- "If you are using frozen mussels (which are usually pre-cooked), simply arrange the mussels in the same way on the baking pan. The mussels will defrost slightly while you put the sauce together."
- "To prepare the sauce, first drop a pinch on Hon Dashi pellets in a medium bowl and dissolve completely with the half and half."
- "Then add the Kewpie Mayo. Combine the mixture with a spoon until smooth."
- "Then add Sriracha and fully incorporate it into the sauce."
- "Do a taste test. If you want it hotter, add more Sriracha.  More milder, add more Kewpie Mayo. If you think you added too much Mayo, add more half and half."
- "The consistency and viscosity of the sauce should be like pancake batter or a softened milk shake."
- "Then spoon the sauce over each mussel. Put just enough to cover the meat completely."
- "Place the mussels under the broiler or toaster oven to cook."
- "Check frequently and rotate the pan occasionally to even out the Browning and compensate for hot spots. Cook until the sauce bubbles and gets golden brown with a few dark spots forming. The total cooking time should not exceed 15 minutes."
