Spaghetti with lentil bolognese has been one of my favorite recipes for a really long time. Delicious vegetarian lentil meatballs made with green lentils, flavoured with olives, parmesan, paprika, fresh chilli and parsley, covered in a fresh cherry tomato tomato sauce flavoured with basil and Chianti wine. The lentil balls are baked in the oven and served on a bed of al dente spaghetti with crusty. Lentils actually make for a great meat substitute - they mimic the texture of beef crumbles fairly well and add a certain earthy toothsome flair that makes you feel really good about every bite. If this is wrong, I don&#39;t want to be right.
