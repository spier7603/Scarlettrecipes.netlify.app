recipeingredient:
- "500 grams Chicken"
- "500 grams mussel"
- "500 grams shrimp"
- "250 grams Sausage"
- "1 onion"
- "2 tbsp olive oil"
- "1000 ml broth"
- "250 grams tomatoes"
- "1 tbsp Spanish paprika"
- "1 tbsp saffron"
- " Salt and pepper to taste"
- "500 grams short grain rice"
- "100 grams parsley"
- "1 lemon sliced"
- "2 tbsp Chile optional"
- "250 grams mussels"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the chicken and sausage: You’ll first want to cook the chicken and sausage in a little bit of olive oil until it starts to brown and is no longer pink. Move the chicken and sausage to one side of the pan and then add the chopped onion and cook for a couple more minutes until the onion becomes soft and translucent."
- "Add garlic and roasted tomatoes: You can then add the garlic, the rice and here I go again with some fire roasted tomatoes. Regular diced tomatoes work just as well."
- "Stir in the broth: Stir everything together then you can add the broth, I used a vegetable broth which is why you see that rich dark color, but chicken broth works as well."
- "Add the spices: Now is the time to add the smoked paprika, hot sauce and saffron. Saffron is quite an expensive spice, but you really want a bit of saffron here, a little goes a long way. You can now cover the paella pan with a large lid, the only large lid I found that fits the paella pan is from my wok, but it worked great or simply use foil for lid."
- "Cook the rice: Cook the rice for about 15 minutes or until the rice has absorbed most of the liquid, but you’ll notice that the rice is still not cooked through."
- "Add seafood and finish the dish: Just arrange the clams, mussels and shrimp around the pan. Cover the pan again and cook for another 10 minutes or until the mussels and clams open up. Finally, garnish this gorgeous dish with some fresh parsley and lemon wedges and you’ve got yourself dinner."
- "Enjoy!"
